- **Restart to get new URL** if needed

### Who Can Access
- **Anyone with the URL** can use your downloader

- **Rate limiting** may apply based on your internet
- **Your bandwidth** is used for uploads

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Tunnel Failed to Start"

```

### "Web App Not Starting"
```bash

python test_spotify_access.py

# Check logs
tail web_app.log
```

### "URL Not Working"
- Make sure tunnel is still running
- Check your internet connection
- Try generating new tunnel URL
- Restart the all-in-one script

### "Slow Performance"

# Close unnecessary apps
# Use airplane mode + WiFi for best stability
```

### Share Responsibly  
- Test with small playlists first
- Monitor your data usage
- Set reasonable download limits
- Don't overload your internet connection

### Backup Strategy
- Keep your .env file safe
- Note down working playlist URLs
- Save important tunnel URLs (they change when restarted)
